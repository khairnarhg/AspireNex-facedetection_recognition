#  Face Detection & Recognition â€“ AspireNex Internship Assignment

This project showcases a complete pipeline for **real-time face detection and recognition**, implemented as part of an internship assignment for **AspireNex**. It includes notebook-based experiments, real-time camera integration, and usage of classical computer vision and modern face recognition libraries.

##  Objectives

- Detect faces in real-time using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
- Recognize faces from a labeled dataset using deep learning-based face encodings
- Real-time face recognition from webcam feed
- Demonstrate technical understanding in image processing and model deployment
